    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

    <p >The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, 
    Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler 
    became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the 
    most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. 
    His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, 
    <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum </i>(1748) remained a standard textbook for well over a century. 
    For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</i> (1768-1772), giving
    a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>

    <p> One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were 
    introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. 
    Euler's formula </p>

    <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e <sup>(ix)</sup></p>

    <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, 
    it's easy to derive the equation</p>

    <p>e <sup>(pi i)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>

    <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, pi, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>

    <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the
     annals of mathematics.</p>

        4 stars I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely.

        Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor. -- Reviewed on Sep. 1, 2010 by GLENDACHEF.

        Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.
